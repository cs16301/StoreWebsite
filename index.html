            After nearly 12 years of construction, The Axiom is finally complete. <br>
            It is the first of our Axiom class of Starliners, and the crown jewel of the BnL fleet. <br>
            With over 600 main decks, and 150 additional auxilary decks, it is by far the largest ship we have ever built. <br>
            Built at a cost of three-and-a-half trillion BnL Credits, it is the most costly single contruction <br>
            project ever. It measures nearly 3 miles long, over a mile tall, and can hold 600,000 passengers. <br>

            Buy-n-Large was founded more than 150 years ago, selling large buckets of high-quality
            yogurt. It was so successful that, within a year, 4 large scale industrial yogurt factories were
            opened. Initially, production robots were purchased from 3rd party companies, however,
            they weren't fit for yogurt production and broke down constantly. To solve this problem,
            a dedicated roboticts branch was created to design new factory robots. It was recorded that
            "The robots were so over-engineered it was almost comical. The robot that filled the yogurt
            buckets was able to fill over 50 one-gallon buckets in less than a minute without spilling anything.
            It was also able to prform qualitiy checks, contamination checks, and most of its own
            maintenance." In short, the refubished factories were so fast with such qualitiy that
            other companies requested to buy the robots for their own factories. The robotics branch would 
            research every client's factory and design robots especially for them.
            The team got so good at designing that only 12 years after the founding of BnL, they launched 
            the world's first personal robot: The Personal Auto-Vacume, a 2,000$ vacume that
            In the decades since, BnL expanded into many other markets. 25 years after founding, BnL points,
            BnL's loyalty program, became BnL Credits, a general purpose currency. 15 years later the first
            BnL Credits Bank opened. By 2090, BnL was evaluated as worth more than the US government, and 5 years
            later, it bailed out the national debt.
